Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game app built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Android development tools. Designed for both web and mobile platforms, 
the app features an interactive and responsive interface where players take turns marking Xs and Os on a 3x3 grid. 
The game includes logic to detect wins, draws, and allows for quick restarts, making it a fun and engaging experience. 
The web version runs smoothly in any browser, while the Android version offers a native-like experience on mobile devices. 
This project showcases the integration of simple game logic with modern UI design and cross-platform development, making it perfect for beginners and 
developers exploring game development. Open-source and customizable, Tic Tac Toe is a great example of combining web technologies with mobile app functionality with ease in work
